REMOVED FROM index.html:
  <!--<script src="js/vendor/bootstrap.min.js"></script>-->

  <!-- requires jQuery and Bootstrap.js :-( -->
  <!--<script src="js/core/directives/bootstrap-popover-menu.js"></script>-->

  <!-- ui-bootstrap-tpls.min.js == (ui-bootstrap.min.js + html templates) -->
  <!-- If you only included ui-bootstrap.min.js, you will also need to provide your own html templates -->


i18n should be done on the server

main.html         --> MainController
  sidenav.html    --> SideNavController
  dashboard.html  --> DashboardController
    masthead.html     (only appears on the dashboard page)

using some embedded templates eg:
  <script id="templateSpaceNew.html" type="text/ng-template">
</script>

has a hidden div called "AlertMsg" that appears in the top left

keep what I like from Permit Solution:

  javascript namespace
    C:\Users\dbalmer\Documents\GitHub\Role-Based-UI\Accela.RBUI\Scripts\SDK\core\global.js (DONE)
  javascript modules (ie: "Accela.module("foo", {}); // but use revealing module pattern
    eg: C:\Users\dbalmer\Documents\GitHub\Role-Based-UI\Accela.RBUI\Scripts\SDK\PermitSDK\address.js

step 1 identify resources (DONE)

  used by Accela.Automation

CoreController (part of Accela.Core)
  app init (using CONFIG)
  using UserManager to get UserProfile and UserSpaces (part of Accela.Core)
  should manage the spaces on the sidenav
  the "+ New" button should just be a ui-sref="..." link
  should listen to global events
    eg: stateChangeError
    how do other controllers subscribe to those events?
      by registering with a common service?
